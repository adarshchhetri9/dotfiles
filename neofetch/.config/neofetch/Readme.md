**if you want to change the speech bubble text**, you can do so by running [bmosay.sh](https://github.com/Chick2D/neofetch-themes/blob/main/small/bmofetch/bmosay.sh) in your terminal:

```bash
 sh path_to_bmofetch/bmosay.sh "your text here"
```

NOTE: You will need to install any one Nerd font and use it in your terminal for the above theme to render the icons correctly.
